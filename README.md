# ANT-ROBOT
The "Ant Robot" is a small-scale robotic system modeled. Utilizing swarm intelligence principles, it navigates and interacts with its environment autonomously. Inspired by nature, this project explores efficient and adaptive robotics, offering insights into collective behaviors and enabling applications in fields such as search-and-rescue missions.
